üè° Getting Started with Lands
Welcome to the Lands system! This guide will help you claim and manage your own territory on the Elderheim Survival Server. Whether you're a solo builder or leading a town, this plugin gives you full control over your land.

‚ú® Creating Your First Land
To begin, simply run:
`/lands claim`
This claims the chunk you're standing on and names the land after your username.
Want to choose a name?
`/lands create <name>`
If you're already part of a land, /lands claim will extend that land.
